      <description>Concept extrapolation is the process of taking a feature determined during a training situation and extrapolating it safely to work more generally.
I&amp;rsquo;m part of a small team from the AI Safety Hub. We&amp;rsquo;re working in collaboration with Oxford-based startup, Aligned AI, to extend their proprietary concept extrapolation algorithm.
More details about the project will be posted upon completion in April!
Skills: PyTorch, Git, NLP</description>

      <title>Robotic Manipulation Using Tactile Feedback: A Strategy for Peg in Hole Insertion Tasks [Video available]</title>

      <description>[The paper produced as a result of this project has since been accepted for presentation at the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)]
Assembly operations account for a significant portion of an entire production cycle. Around 40% of these operations can be reduced to a peg-in-hole task. This makes the task a useful starting point to develop new strategies.
This project investigated a peg insertion strategy that made sole use of tactile sensing throughout.</description>

      <title>Indoor Delivery Robot - Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance [Video available]</title>

      <description>The aim of this project was to develop a robot capable of delivering parcels within apartment buildings, in an attempt to solve one section of the last-mile delivery problem.
Here we simulate a robot attempting to get from a starting position to a recipients door.
Key steps: The robot is assumed to have access to the building&amp;rsquo;s floorplan. A probabilistic roadmap planner is then used to calculate an ideal path to the goal from it&amp;rsquo;s starting point.</description>
