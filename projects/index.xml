      <description>As a beginner guitarist, practicing became much more enjoyable once I learnt the basic chords because I could pick up new songs faster. To help accelerate this initial learning process, I developed an app that leverages Google&amp;rsquo;s MediaPipe for hand-tracking and PyTorch for training a neural network to identify the chords you&amp;rsquo;re playing. You can see more details about this project on my GitHub.</description>

      <description>I was part of a small team from the AI Safety Hub. We worked with Oxford-based startup, Aligned AI, to extend their proprietary concept extrapolation algorithm. Due to IP concerns, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t go into detail about our findings - but you can find an overview of the problem below.
Motivation Suppose you deployed a powerful black-box language model as a chatbot and then, when somebody asked it how to make a bomb, your chatbot answered.</description>

      <title>Robotic Manipulation Using Tactile Feedback: A Strategy for Peg in Hole Insertion Tasks [Video available]</title>

      <description>[The paper produced as a result of this project has since been accepted for presentation at the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)]
Assembly operations account for a significant portion of an entire production cycle. Around 40% of these operations can be reduced to a peg-in-hole task. This makes the task a useful starting point to develop new strategies.
This project investigated a peg insertion strategy that made sole use of tactile sensing throughout.</description>

      <title>Indoor Delivery Robot - Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance [Video available]</title>

      <description>The aim of this project was to develop a robot capable of delivering parcels within apartment buildings, in an attempt to solve one section of the last-mile delivery problem.
Here we simulate a robot attempting to get from a starting position to a recipients door.
Key steps: The robot is assumed to have access to the building&amp;rsquo;s floorplan. A probabilistic roadmap planner is then used to calculate an ideal path to the goal from it&amp;rsquo;s starting point.</description>
